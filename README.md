# QA-chatbot-using-RAG
 I developed an abstractive QA chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Langchain, experimenting with various vector stores and retrievers, and evaluated their effectiveness; envisioning its application in the medical field, I aimed to extract case-specific data to enhance case management and improve healthcare outcomes.

## Implementations
- [x] Implemented a basic RAG pipeline.
- [x] Experimented with different types of embedding models and made observations.
- [x] Worked with various retrievers and conducted experiments with them.
- [x] Applied advanced RAG techniques such as Contextual Compression, Ensemble retriever, ColBERT retriever, etc.
- [x] Integrated Cohere reranker and cross encoder reranker for enhanced ranking.
- [x] Evaluated the RAG pipeline using different evaluation metrics.
